# Minima-tutorials
A series of Minima blockchain tutorials, from basic to complex

- **Tutorial 1: Understand UTXO model**
  - This tutorial will show you how the UTXO model works on minima, you will be able to create a wallet address and send minima coins between two nodes on their wallet addresses using terminal minima command line console.
  - It can be done using one computer running two nodes, two different comupters running one node each one or two mobiles.
  - You need 1 minima to do the tutorial, so ask someone to send 1 minima to you on the channel minima discord channel "#app-chat", to your wallet address.

- **Tutorial 2: Send Tokens**
  - This tutorial will show you how to send tokens, you will be able to locate the _tokenid_  ,needed to send tokens between two nodes on their wallet addresses using terminal minima command line console.
  - It can be done using one computer running two nodes, two different comupters running one node each one or two mobiles.
  - You need some tokens to do the tutorial, so ask someone to send some tokens to you on the channel minima discord channel "#app-chat", to your wallet address.

- **Tutorial 3: Create Token  part 1**
  - This is the first part of two on how to use minima terminal commands to teach and explain how to create Tokens using minima coins, and also the first part to introduce what transaction are and how to check and understand the console output response to the create token command.

- **Tutorial 4: Create Token  part 2**
  - This is the second part on how to use minima terminal commands to teach and explain how to create Tokens using minima coins, but using extra parameters to add more info to the Token using the JSON structure to give more info than a simple name.
  - We are going to create 2 tokens that will represent power tokens in a very simple game, a game made with GODOT engine that will react when the node where the game is running receive one of those power tokens in the wallet address of the node, making the game react and changing the color and the size of the objects or player with the properties of the token's power received.
    - **--------->  UNDER CONSTRUCTION  <-------------**

- **Tutorial 5: Create Simple DAO**
  - This is the first part of several where we try to build a simpleDAO (People with a governance token) will have the power to vote a proposal (First part will be a fixed proposal).
  - We will use Tokens, smart contracts, some html, javascript or GODOT prefixed environment to test it.
